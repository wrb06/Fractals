## Julia Set
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set), the Julia set consists of values such that an arbitrarily small perturbation can cause drastic changes in the sequence of iterated function values. ![Image](https://github.com/wrb06/Fractals/blob/master/JuliaSet/ExampleSet.png)

## Julia Set 3D
As well as the set being coloured based on the iterations of the main convergence testing loop, it is now displaid as a 3d model with taller boxes being quicker divergence. This leads to valleys and very interesting terrain artifacts. ![Image](https://github.com/wrb06/Fractals/blob/master/JuliaSet3D/3dExample.png)

## Ikeda Map
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikeda_map), The original map was proposed first by Kensuke Ikeda as a model of light going around across a nonlinear optical resonator (ring cavity containing a nonlinear dielectric medium) in a more general form. ![Image](https://github.com/wrb06/Fractals/blob/master/IkedaMap/IkedaMap.png)

## Mandelbrot Set
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set), The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers c for which the function f(z) = z^2 + c  does not diverge when iterated from z = 0. i.e., for which the sequence f(0), f(f(0)), etc., remains bounded in absolute value. ![Image](https://github.com/wrb06/Fractals/blob/master/MandelbrotSet/small.png)
